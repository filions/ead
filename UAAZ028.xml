			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Jacob E. Ludy was a civil engineer who helped build the Yuma canals in the early
				1900's. He is regarded as an Arizona Pioneer in the Yuma Valley.</p>
			<p>Mr. Ludy was born in Mercer County, Missouri, in 1858. He was six years old when his
				family moved to the Sacrament valley near Butte City California. He attended Pierce
				Christian College for four years and afterwards moved to the Washington State where
				he worked in engineering and railroad construction. He was named County Surveyor of
				Lincoln County, Washington and afterward City Surveyor of Davenport and Sprague,
				Washington.</p>
			<p>In 1898 Mr. Ludy relocated to Yuma, Arizona where he began surveying for the
				Irrigation, Land and Improvement Company, he later became the general manager and
				vice president of the company. The Irrigation, Land and Improvement Company built
				sixty miles of canals which irrigated fifty thousand acres of land in Yuma
				County.</p>
			<p>Ludy was employed by the Irrigation, Land and Improvement Company until 1908 when it
				was absorbed by the United States Government. In 1910 He moved to Imperial Valley,
				California where he worked on another important irrigation project in the California
				desert. Mr. Ludy returned to Yuma to supervise a Colorado River protection project
				for two years. In 1913 he moved his family to Palo Verde Valley, California where
				became the chief engineer for the California Farms and Irrigation Company. His last
				job was working for the government as an engineer on the Colorado River. Mr. Jacob
				E. Ludy died in 1921.</p>
