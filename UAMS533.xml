	 <head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
  	<p>This collection is comprised of mp3 files of oral histories with Mexican and U.S. journalists, activists, and dignitaries that discuss the state of journalism within Mexico, specifically the decline of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in that country's northern states.  The majority of the interviews were conducted in person on location in Mexico City, Mexico and San Antonio, TX, with a few conducted via telephone or Skype.  Common themes explored in these interviews include violence and crimes committed against journalists, the decline of freedom of journalism and freedom of expression in Mexico, the work being done by organizations to combat these issues, and the state of journalism under the administration of President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa.  Other themes discussed are the internal and external pressures facing the journalism profession, including lack of training and pressure from the government to self-censor.  The majority of materials were conducted in Spanish with a few conducted in English.</p>
