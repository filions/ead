	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Morris "Mo" King Udall of Tucson, Arizona was born in St. Johns, Arizona
		on June 15, 1922. He is the grandson of David King Udall, a noted Mormon
		pioneer and church leader, the son of Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Levi
		S. Udall and Louise Lee Udall and brother of former Congressman and Secretary
		of the Interior, Stewart Lee Udall.</p> 
	 <p>He attended public schools in St. Johns, Arizona and was awarded a J.D.
		degree from the University of Arizona in 1949 where he served as President of the
		Associated Student Government and co-captain of the basketball team.</p> 
	 <p>He entered the United States Army-Air Force as a private in 1942 and was
		discharged as a captain in 1946, having served in the Pacific Theatre.</p> 
	 <p>Mo played professional basketball for one season (1948-1949) with the
		Denver Nuggets and is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.</p> 
	 <p>He started a law firm with his brother, Stewart in Tucson, Arizona in
		1949 and served as Pima County Attorney from 1952-1954. He served as
		Vice-President of the Arizona Bar Association in 1961, was a co-founder of
		the Bank of Tucson and the Catalina Savings and Loan Association, and served as
		president of the Tucson YMCA in 1960.</p> 
	 <p>When his brother, Stewart resigned from the House of Representatives
		(District 2, Arizona) to serve as Secretary of the Interior in the Kennedy
		Administration, Morris K. Udall was elected to his seat in the 87th Congress
		(1961-1962). He served in each succeeding Congress until his resignation on May
		4, 1991.</p> 
	 <p>Morris K. Udall served as chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives
		Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1977 to 1991. He also was the
		ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p> 
	 <p>He was a candidate in the Democratic primaries for President in the 1976
		national campaign. He was the keynote speaker at the Democratic National
		Convention in New York in 1980. In 1992, a special tribute was paid to Morris
		K. Udall by the Democratic Party at their national convention.</p>

				<p>On October 15, 1962, the 87th Congress House Interior and
				  Insular Affairs Committee Chairman Wayne N. Aspinall (D-Colorado) wrote to
				  President John F. Kennedy suggesting the need for a broader examination of
				  public land policy and inviting submission of the President's views to the 88th
				  Congress. The President concurred and instructed the Secretaries of the
				  Interior (Stewart Udall) and Agriculture (Orville Freeman) to represent him. On
				  August 14, 1963, Chairman Aspinall introduced a bill to establish the Public
				  Land Law Review Commission and on September 19, 1964, President Johnson signed
				  Public Law 88-606 establishing the PLLRC with 19 members. The commission was
				  charged to make a comprehensive review of the public land laws and the rules,
				  regulations, policies and practices of Federal, state and local governments and
				  agencies; recommend any necessary modifications and prepare a final report.
				  </p> 
				<p>Congressman Aspinall was named Chairman, six members were
				  appointed by the President, six by the U.S. Senate and six by the U.S. House.
				  The Senate and House members changed from time to time, because of election
				  defeats and resignations. Thirty-four individuals were selected by the
				  Commission and Federal agencies to serve as an Advisory Council. The commission
				  was authorized to hire fifty-four staff members and Milton Pearl served as the
				  Director from 1964-1970. Congressman Morris K. Udall served on the Commission
				  from 1967 to 1970, when the final report was issued and the commission
				  disbanded.</p> 
				<p>Arranged chronologically within six broad series: the
				  correspondence of Congressman Udall related to the commission; the PLLRC
				  operational materials including background, history, correspondence, memos,
				  press releases, personnel, procedures and public meetings, budget, transcripts,
				  clippings, final reports, conferences and speeches; Chairman Aspinall's papers
				  including correspondence, reference materials, clippings, and speeches; the
				  subject study areas of the PLLRC; Director Milton Pearl's files and copies of
				  reports which are also arranged by the same subject study areas. The subject
				  study area files include draft and final reports, correspondence with
				  contractors performing the studies and reviews of the reports. The subject
				  study areas include: 
				  <list>

				<p>Contains correspondence, telegrams, memos, press releases,
				  annotated drafts of subject study area reports and final reports, reviews of
				  reports, maps, clippings and speeches. The bulk of these files relate to the
				  subject study areas listed above. Deaccessioned from these series were
				  duplicate copies of reports, correspondence, clippings, reference materials,
				  government publications, memos, and routine commission administrative files
				  including receipts for supplies, telephone, stamps, job requests, contractors
				  expense vouchers, requests for publications and mass mailing postcards.</p>
